          <h2>Happiness and Freedom</h2>
          <p>
            The Declaration of Independence is the most important document of
            Early American literature as it effectively sums up centuries worth
            of sentiments surrounding happiness and freedom, notably seen in its
            incorporation of themes common to Puritan and non-Puritan works.

      <h3>Puritan values of happiness</h3>
      <p>
        The importance of a tight-knit community is reflected in both Puritan
        works as well as the Declaration of Independence.

        The non-puritan perspective on happiness, which involves materialistic
        wealth, improvement, and manifest destiny is evident in the Declaration
        of Independence as well.

          The Indians perceive gratitude as the central principle in attaining

            The Declaration of Independence combines elements of happiness and

            The Declaration of Independence should be preserved for its ability
