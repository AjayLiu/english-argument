          <h2>Happiness and Freedom</h2>
          <p>
            The Declaration of Independence is the most important document of
            Early American literature as it effectively sums up centuries worth
            of sentiments surrounding happiness and freedom, notably seen in its
            incorporation of themes common to Puritan and non-Puritan works,
            even including Native American values that existed long before the
            arrival of the English.

            The Declaration of Independence combines elements of happiness and

          <li>
            The Declaration of Independence should be preserved for its ability
            to capture the core values of the time and its contribution to what
            will become the American Dream.
