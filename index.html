          <h2>Happiness and Freedom</h2>
          <p>
            The Declaration of Independence effectively sums up centuries worth
            of sentiments surrounding happiness and freedom, notably seen in its
            incorporation of themes common to Puritan and non-Puritan works,
            even including Native American values that existed long before the
            arrival of the English.
